Your game can be in a number of states. For example, the main character can have the following states: jump, walk, run, etc. Now you want an easy way to switch between the states. Easiest way is the using enum. In this way we can easily use with switch case condition. However this is not the optimized solution. Let's think about it. We want to add new state. If we use enum, we cant add new state easily or control the states. If we want to optimized way, we should use class. So, how to develop the State machine?
You can look my project for codes.
<h3> How to create a new State </h3>
- Create new script.

- Take inheritance from "IState".

- Create new constructor method and add "PlayerController" value.

- Add class  to PlayerStateManager as a variable.

- Do assignment to PlayerStateManager constructor's method.

- Finished. Your state is ready.

Now try to create new State and push into the reposity.

I hope you understand ^^
